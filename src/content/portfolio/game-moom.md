title: MOOM - Last Promise
desc: A 3D platformer metroidvania developed in 1 month for a celebration event. I worked as an assistant director in a team of 12 people, doing level and movement design, alongside all UI design and general art pipeline management. I also directed and edited the game's trailer by myself.
